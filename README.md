As simple as adding the entrant's name and number of entries and hitting submit. Displays the total entries, the number of entries for each entrant, and the odds of winning for each entrant. Randomizes on every submit and again when the winner is chosen. Displays a shuffling ticker-like effect to visualize the randomization when you pick a winner.
